# SecureAuthX-Authentication-and-Middleware üîê
SecureAuthX is a comprehensive authentication and session management system that seamlessly integrates MongoDB, Node.js, and Express.js, fortified with bcrypt.js for password hashing. This ensures robust security and efficient data storage for your application's users while keeping their credentials safeguarded.

## Features

- **Authentication**: SecureAuthX provides a secure authentication system to verify user identity before granting access to protected resources.
  
- **Session Management**: It manages user sessions securely, ensuring that users stay authenticated throughout their interaction with the application.

- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt.js, enhancing security by securely storing user passwords in the database.
